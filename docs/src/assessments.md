# Automated Assessments

Creating test cases is probably the simplest form of an automated assessment on
students' programs. It has been, and still is, the approach utilized by many
autograding systems (*e.g.*, Gradescope).

However, there is a notable difference between using test cases on students'
programs and in regular software testing.

- **Students cannot see test case details**

The reason is simple, since I would like to re-use them for future course
offerings.

So, given this constraint, how can I achieve the target that give automated
feedback only on previously considered solutions and seek human feedback for
other cases?
